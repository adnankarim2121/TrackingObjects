Code for tracking a red,green, or blue object in C++ using opencv.
Please ensure to have opencv installed on your computer. To set up on a mac, I used the following tutorial:

I compile and run my program on xcode, as it seems easiest to run opencv for cpp there. 

To run,
compile program and launch. In the console, the program will ask the user to select a color. Please be aware that the entry must be input correctly or else an error will be shown. Once that is complete, the program should run as expected.
